# Achtung! Cthulhu 2d20 System for Foundry VTT

***Achtung! Cthulhu** is a setting for Lovecraftian roleplaying during World War II, which allows players to discover the truth behind the malign influence of the Mythos on the Nazi war machine and beyond, as conflict engulfs the globe during 1939-1945.*

*In this pulp-influenced world of brave Allied heroes and dauntless two-fisted adventure, players will take on the roles of Allied servicemen and women, secret agents, members of the resistance or even hapless civilians caught up in the wider conflict. All stand firm against the twisted might of the Nazi occult: the Cult of the Black Sun, who wield foul magic and summon captive horrors in their bid to unleash Yog-Sothoth, and *Nachtw√∂lfe*, their nominal allies and rivals who place their trust in Atlantean technology, weird science, and strange wonder weapons to prevail.*
